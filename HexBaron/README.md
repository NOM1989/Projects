# Hex Baron

Hex Baron is a two-player game in which players issue commands to control pieces on a grid of hexagonal tiles. The winner is the player who has the most victory points at the end of the game.

I did not make this, it is Preliminary Material for a previous Computer Science A Level exam. This folder contains adaptions I have made to the code as well as the raw code provided by AQA themselves (`raw-hexbaron.py`). Additional information such as how to play can be found in `Computer-Science-A-8Jun21.pdf`.
